fortnite_api allow you to retrieve informations from Fortnite in an easy way through fortnitetracker.com API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fortnite_api'
```

## Usage

Initialize the API with your fortnitetracker.com API key's:
```ruby
fortnite = FortniteApi::Api.new('Enter your API Key here')
```

Enter the player's profile and the platform which you want to retrieve the informations (for the platform you have the choice between 'pc' for PC, 'xbl' for Xbox and 'psn' for Playstation):
```ruby
player = fortnite.get_json('pc','Ninja')
```

Now you have a player object with the following informations:

**Return the username:**
```ruby
player.epicuserhandle # return the username as a string
=> "Ninja"
```

**Return the platform:**
```ruby
player.platformnamelong # return the platform as a string
=> "PC"
```

```ruby
player.stats # return the stats as a hash
=> {"p2"=>{"trnRating"=>{"label"=>"TRN Rating", "field"=>"TRNRating", "category"=>"Rating", "valueInt"=>4543, "value"=>"4543", "rank"=>2080,..., "value"=>"392.45", "percentile"=>0.6, "displayValue"=>"392.45"}}}
```

**Return the lifetime stats:**
```ruby
player.lifetimestats # return the lifetime stats as an array
=> [{"key"=>"Top 3", "value"=>"1518"}, {"key"=>"Top 5s", "value"=>"1318"}, {"key"=>"Top 3s", "value"=>"387"}, {"key"=>"Top 6s", "value"=>"477"},..., "value"=>"54518"}, {"key"=>"K/d", "value"=>"11.05"}]
```

```

```ruby
player.stats['curr_p2']['top10'] # return the current solo top10 informations
=> {"label"=>"Top 10", "field"=>"Top10", "category"=>"Tops", "valueInt"=>49, "value"=>"49", "rank"=>9512, "percentile"=>0.2, "displayValue"=>"49"}
